The folder contains the following sub folders:
muR_muF_0p5 muR_muF_1  muR_muF_2
Which contain the inclusive A-coefficients and differential dA-coefficients for the renormalization and factorization scales muR = muF = {0.5*c,1*c,2*c}, where c = m_hh/2. They also contin the covaraince matrices for the A-coefficients and dA-coefficients.


The subfolders contain the following files
HEFT_CovMat_for_A_muR_muF_*.txt HEFT_CovMat_for_dA_muR_muF_*.txt HEFT_dA_and_A_with_Binning_250_1050_41_Variable_Bins_1200_1400_muR_muF_*.txt


Where,

HEFT_dA_and_A_with_Binning_250_1050_41_Variable_Bins_1200_1400_muR_muF_*.txt - contain the inclusive A-coefficients and differential dA-coefficients.
The inclusive A-coefficients are on the last row, while the differential dA-coefficients are divided bin-by-bin where the first value is the central mhh value of that bin.

HEFT_CovMat_for_dA_muR_muF_*.txt - contain the covariance matrix for the differential dA-coefficients and are divided bin-by-bin where the first value is the central mhh value of that bin.

HEFT_CovMat_for_A_muR_muF_*.txt - contain the covariance matrix for the inclusive A-coefficients.
